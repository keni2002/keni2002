Hi, I am [@kenilee](https://github.com/keni2002). ðŸ‘‹ I am the CEO of @YerbisUniverses and I love creating software that makes life easier for others. My journey into technology began in high school, when I asked an old teacher what software was made of.

ðŸš€ At the end of 2016, I founded Yerbis Universes, Inc. A company dedicated to producing software and other services related to information and communications technologies. As long as they were in harmony with nature and the universe.
